Repository made with the intention of informing and seeing my progress in Dart studies

Dart is a programming language developed by Google. It was publicly released in 2011 and gained popularity primarily as the default programming language for mobile app development using the Flutter framework.

Here are some key features of Dart:

# Optional typing: Dart supports static typing, which means you can specify types for variables, function parameters, and return types, providing increased safety during compilation. However, typing can also be optional, allowing you to write more dynamic code if desired.

# Object-oriented: Dart is an object-oriented language, which means you can use concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism to structure your code.

# Efficient memory management: Dart has a built-in garbage collector that automatically manages memory, freeing up space occupied by unused objects.

# Asynchronous and await/async: Dart has native support for asynchronous programming. You can use the async and await keywords to write asynchronous code in a more concise and readable manner.

# Just-in-time (JIT) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation: Dart is a compiled language. It can be run in just-in-time (JIT) compilation mode, which enables rapid development and facilitates debugging. It can also be compiled in ahead-of-time (AOT) mode, resulting in highly optimized code for better performance and smaller app size.

# Flutter: Flutter is a cross-platform app development framework, also developed by Google, that uses Dart as its primary language. With Flutter, you can build apps for mobile devices (iOS and Android), web, and desktop using a shared codebase.

Dart has gained popularity, particularly because of Flutter, which offers an efficient way to create high-performance mobile apps with a beautiful user interface.
